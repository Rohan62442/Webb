{"name":"Webb","tagline":"A collection of GNOME web applications that use the Epiphany web browser.","body":"# Webb\r\n\r\nWebb is an installer for web applications based on GNOME's Epiphany web browser,\r\nwhich is now simply known as [Web] (https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Web). It makes installation and removal of these applications\r\nfairly easy and accessible via the command-line. Just use this:\r\n\r\n  ` webb -i webapp1 webapp2 ...`\r\n\r\n  ` webb -r webapp1 webapp2 ...`\r\n\r\nAlso, make sure you have `~/.local/bin` in your `$PATH` environment variable. And NEVER run\r\nthis script as root.\r\n\r\n## Contributing workflow\r\n\r\nHere’s how I suggest you go about proposing a change to this project:\r\n\r\n1. [Fork this project][fork] to your account.\r\n2. [Create a branch][branch] for the change you intend to make.\r\n3. Make your changes to your fork.\r\n4. [Send a pull request][pr] from your fork’s branch to my `master` branch.\r\n\r\nUsing the web-based interface to make changes is fine too, and will help you\r\nby automatically forking the project and prompting to send a pull request too.\r\n\r\n[fork]: http://help.github.com/forking/\r\n[branch]: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository\r\n[pr]: http://help.github.com/pull-requests/\r\n\r\nPlease submit bugs and feature requests [here] (https://github.com/Rohan62442/Webb/issues).\r\n\r\nYou can get the latest source [here] (https://github.com/Rohan62442/Webb).\r\n\r\n  `git clone git@github.com:Rohan62442/Webb.git`\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n[GNU General Public License v3](./COPYING)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
