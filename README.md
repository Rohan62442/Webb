# Webb

Webb is an installer for web applications based on GNOME's Epiphany web browser,
which is now simply known as Web. It makes installation and removal of these applications
fairly easy and accessible via the command-line. Just use this:

  `webb install webapp1 webapp2 ...
  `webb remove webapp1 webapp2 ...

Also, make sure you have `~/.local/bin` in your `$PATH` environment variable.

## Contributing workflow

Here’s how I suggest you go about proposing a change to this project:

1. [Fork this project][fork] to your account.
2. [Create a branch][branch] for the change you intend to make.
3. Make your changes to your fork.
4. [Send a pull request][pr] from your fork’s branch to my `master` branch.

Using the web-based interface to make changes is fine too, and will help you
by automatically forking the project and prompting to send a pull request too.
